# Backstage - Headless WordPress
This project started out as a clone of [Postlight's Headless WordPress + React Starter Kit](https://github.com/postlight/headless-wp-starter). It contains only WordPress as back-end and lets the user hook on any kind of front end solution. It also contains a node script for making a WordPress installation with the Backstage solution as base.

Backstage comes with a custom built plugin for handling REST API endpoint exposure and CORS settings.
